- Do a proper pass for the instruction IDA Features (./helpers/asm662-66207.op.modified)
- Differentiate addresses from immediates (done using ida/ida-helper.py)
- Add support for DD/CF bits (to be able to control them from the interface, like m7700 M flag)
- Add proper support for DD flag (Ongoing)
- Check all instructions and compare with dasm662
- Verify how current/zero page addressing affects instructions (LRB register...)
